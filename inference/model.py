inference/model.py

Owner: Ishan

Loads YOLOv8n (pretrained on COCO) and runs person detection on a single
input image. Filters detections down to the "person" class (COCO class 0)
and returns a clean list of bounding boxes + confidence scores.

This module ONLY detects people and where they are in the frame. It does
NOT decide who is in the queue, who is seated, or who is staff — that's
zone logic, handled downstream by inference/zones.py and
inference/metrics.py (owned by Curio). This module has no knowledge of
zones, camera_id, or business logic — keep it that way so it stays easy
to swap models (e.g. YOLOv8n -> YOLOv8s) without touching anything else.

Output contract (do not change without telling Curio + the ingestion API):
    [
        {"bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2], "confidence": 0.87},
        {"bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2], "confidence": 0.63},
        ...
    ]
    bbox is [x1, y1, x2, y2] = top-left corner, bottom-right corner, in
    ORIGINAL-IMAGE pixel coordinates (not model-input/resized space —
    ultralytics rescales box.xyxy back to the source image size by
    default, regardless of the imgsz used for inference). zones.json
    polygons must be defined in this same original-image coordinate
    space, or every point-in-polygon check silently returns false and
    all metrics read zero with no error raised anywhere.

    Zone-layer logic (owned by Curio) derives whichever reference point
    it needs from each bbox to test against zone polygons — e.g.
    centroid ((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2) or bottom-center ((x1+x2)/2, y2).
    This is a zone-layer decision, not fixed by this module, and may
    change independent of anything here. bbox format itself (corners,
    original-image space) is the only part of the contract that's fixed.

    On no detections, returns [] — never None. An empty hall/frame is a
    normal case, not an error; treating it as anything but a plain empty
    list would break the ingestion endpoint on every poll where nobody's
    in frame.
